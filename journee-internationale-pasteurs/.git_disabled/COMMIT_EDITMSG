feat: Migrate from Decap CMS to Astro Starlight

This commit migrates the project's content management and documentation from Decap CMS to the Astro Starlight documentation theme.

- **Remove Decap CMS:**
  - Deleted the `decap-config.yml` configuration file.
  - Removed `decap-cms` from `package.json` dependencies.

- **Integrate Astro Starlight:**
  - Added `@astrojs/starlight` as a new dependency.
  - Configured Starlight in `astro.config.mjs` with JIP branding, a custom logo, and theme styling.
  - Implemented a new bilingual (fr/en) sidebar navigation structure.
  - Set up social media links for GitHub and Twitter.

- **Update Project Configuration:**
  - Added `"type": "module"` to `package.json` and updated scripts for Astro development (`dev`, `build`, `preview`).
  - Updated `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js` to use ESM syntax.
  - Added `.idea`, `.qodo`, and `dist` directories to `.gitignore`.

- **Refactor Tailwind CSS:**
  - Updated the color palette with more vibrant primary and secondary brand colors.
  - Added new animations (`fade-in`, `slide-up`, `float`) and corresponding keyframes.
  - Updated font family declarations to include quotes for font names with spaces.
